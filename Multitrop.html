							<h1>Multitrop Project</h1>
							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>As an Assembly Team Member of the <b>Multitrop Project</b>, a space farming experiment sent on the ISS during expedition 52, I helped a team of mechanical and electrical engineers from <b>ASI, ESA, </b>and  <b>Kayser Italia</b> to compile assembly procedures and assemble the actual experiment unit. I have also participated in the research aspect of the mission, researching the interaction between plants and different space farming conditions. I presented the project in seminars organized by ASI, attended by over 300 experts and students.

							<h2>Project Goals</h2>
							<p>Both the research goals and design criteria for the mission are listed below:
								<ul class="alt">
												<li>Use refurbished hardware to create space farming habitats for microgravity experiments</li>
												<li>Study the interaction between the plant roots and various growth conditions</li>
												<li>Gain insight into the reusability of pre-existing space hardware</li>												
												<li>Develop new insight into optimal space farming conditions</li>

											</ul>

							<h2>Project Overview</h2>
							<h3>Experiment unit</h3>
							<p>The experiment unit is a <b>YING-B2</b> capsule from Kayser Italia specifically adapted and refurbished for the Multitrop Mission. The individual culture chambers (shown on the right) house the seeds studied in the experiment. The piston on the bottom of the chamber injects fixative stopping the plant’s growth before the experiment’s re-entry into the atmosphere, and is actuated using SMA springs. 3D-printed holders grasp the agar-like terrain on which the seeds grow. Everything is housed in an experiment unit (shown on the left) which also contains the electrical components.

							<h3>Assembly Procedure</h3>
							<p>The assembly procedure was divided into biological, mechanical, and electrical assemblies. My team assembled both the mechanical components and the biological parts of the experiment. The seeds and the terrain needed to be thoroughly sterilized and inserted into the chamber with great precision, while the mechanical components needed to be assembled to precise specifications, so as not to compromise the integrity of the experiment unit.

							<h3>Launch</h3>
							<p>The experiment launched aboard <b>SpaceX CRS 11</b>, a commercial resupply mission to the ISS during Expedition 52. The astronaut responsible for the experiment was Paolo Nespoli (shown on the left). The experiment was successfully brought back to Earth and the results were published in various publications.
